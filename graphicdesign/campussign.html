                <h4>Location & Message</h4>
                <p>For the first part of our project, our team was randomly assigned a location. Our group was tasked to work with the hub at the intersection of A St. and 3rd St.: the street dividing the UC Davis central campus from downtown Davis. We visited the site to identify the audience and research the needs our directional sign should fulfill. We considered whether the area consisted of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, and what kind of information and types of directional messages would be helpful at this hub.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>concept</h4>
                <p>Next, we began sketching ideas for our sign. It needed to provide orientation or direct people to at least three different locations, with the inclusion of arrowa and pictograms. Additionally, we neded to consider an appropriate typeface style that followed ADA guidelines.</p>
                <div class="project-images">
                    <img src="../images/campussign_sketch.png" alt="" width="1000" height="420" draggable="false">
                </div>
                <p>After discussion, we decided to design our directional sign as three standing panels side-by-side, with cutout arrows to indicate the directions while the sign detailed the common locations per respective direction. We wanted to place our sign on the campus side of the intersection, as there was an orientational map nearby and felt our directional sign would be helpful near it. However, we soon realized that this location was difficult to place a sign, as it was only viewable from one angle: this would make it easy to follow from people coming from the campus side, but not for people approaching from any other street. Additionally, this placement would allow only for people on campus to view the sign if they were passing by on the way downtown, making the sign inaccessible to those who were coming from other directions.</p>
                <p>We reconsidered our idea, instead deciding to expand on another idea: a three-paneled sign placed in the shape of a triangular prism. That way, the sign could be viewable by people coming from all angles, and would only have to contain information that were in the directions they were heading. We also decided to change the location of our sign placement, instead moving it to the downtown side of the intersection, where it could also be viewable from a distance due to the colored arrows that indicated the different directions.</p>
                <div id="small-image" class="project-images">
                    <img src="" alt="" width="1000" height="" draggable="false">
                </div>
                <p>After, we selected and refined our sign, considering the grid, constrast, legibility, color, form, and scale of elements. We then built a preliminary scale model (1 in. to 1 ft.) of our solution for class review.</p>
                <div id="small-image" class="project-images">
                    <img src="../images/campussign-home.png" alt="renderedsign" width="1280" height="716" draggable="false">
                </div>
                <p>After creating our scale, we received feedback from our professor, Tim McNeil, and the class. We added the logo for the city of Davis, and also designed recognizable pictograms to represent. Additionally, we changed the colors of our sign from the Davis school colors to something that was less associated to the school and more friendly to all audiences in the city. These colors, previously taking up the trangular shape of the sign, were also inversed to increase readability and contrast.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Construction</h4>
                <p>Lastly, we needed to render our final sign design for output at actual size. We printed out the panels of our sign and glued them to cardboard, attaching them to wooden stakes using velcro strips. We then visited each location as a class, placing our full-size sign prototypes at our predetermined placement location for evaluation.</p>
                <div class="project-images">
                    <img src="../images/campussign_prototype.png" alt="signprototype" width="2070" height="700" draggable="false">
                </div>
                <p>For submission, we also rendered our sign in-situ.</p>
                <div class="project-images">
                    <img src="../images/campussign-insitu.png" alt="signprototype" width="2966" height="700" draggable="false">
                </div>
                <h4>Additional Notes & Takeaways</h4>
                <p>From this project, I learned that there are so many more things to signage than just simply making it look aesthetically pleasing, and that even doing something as small as making a tiny scale model can really help put things into perspective. Additionally, I came to appreciate and even look forward to feedback, as it helped me to better understand that getting a fresh perspecive is just as important.</p>
                <p>I want to thank my amazing teammates for being so communicative and hands-on, making this experience feel like a project among friends! I also want to thank our professor Tim McNeil, who provided critiques that helped us be more considerate of the ADA guidelines while making our project exponentially better.</p>
