                <h4>Location & Message</h4>
                <p>For the first part of the design process, I considered what kind of message I wanted to send out with my design and where to place it so that it could be best received in its context. I started by taking a walk around the Design building, observing the vinyl messages left behind by previous students of this project and taking note of which ones I reacted to the most. I found that many of the humorous messages left a stronger impression on me, as they were often messages that comically conveyed the exhaustion of being a design student in a way that is relatable to those currently experiencing the same thing. These kinds of messages, although small, made me feel more connected to my design peers because it uplifted me, and I wanted my project to elicit the same sort of reaction from my audience as well.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>concept & construction</h4>
                <p>For my design, I decided to recreate a common "do not disturb" sign with an entertaining twist. I used the variation of the sign often used in wildlife conservation areas that state "do not disturb the local wildlife". Instead of keeping the usual pictograms of animals, I inserted my own pictogram of a student doing design work while looking visibly stumped. I wanted this student to represent a universal student and bring a smile to peoples' faces.</p>
                <div id="small-image" class="project-images">
                    <img src="../images/tattoo.png" alt="tattoodesign" width="354" height="500" draggable="false">
                </div>
                <p>I thought that this sign would best fit into its environment in an area people could easily see when they first step into the building, as a "warning" that would make them pause before realizing the humor behind it. I wanted my message to be able to create a lighthearted and welcoming atmosphere to all audiences, whether it be their first or hundredth time stepping into Cruess Hall.</p>
                <p>However, the lobby area of the building already felt saturated with a lot of information, including a TV displaying design work of various students, a message board promoting the current exhibit at the Design Museum, and many other messages already tattooed to the walls. I felt that my design would get lost in the amount of work that was already displayed here, so I decided to change locations. Instead, I decided to place my message on the wall facing the audience when they come up the stairs to the second floor of the building, where many of the design classrooms are located.</p>
                <div id="small-image" class="project-images">
                    <img src="../images/cruesstattoo.png" alt="cruesstattoo" width="774" height="500" draggable="false">
                </div>
                <hr>
                <h4>takeaways</h4>
                <p>From this project, I was able to consider messages in design in a more thoughtful and personal way, including how they can influence a space or be perceived differently based on where it is located. Additionally, I was also able to learn more about the fabrication process of printing, weeding, and putting up vinyl, such as how detailed I can make the sign or how thin the lines need to be to still be visible from a distance.</p>
                <p>Being able to see my message go from the screen to a physical sign on the wall was definitely the best part of this project, and I'm very happy to have left a lasting impact on UC Davis' Design building!</p>
