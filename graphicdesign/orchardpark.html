                <h4>phase one</h4>
                <h4>design research & visual language</h4>
                <p>To approach this project, we first visited the Orchard Park Apartment housing. We found that the space was lacking in a coherent sign system, and that the site felt more like a corporate workplace building than a residential space.</p>
                <p>As the apartment complex was primarily graduate and family housing, we wanted incorporate fun colors and forms to bring more personality to the space to appeal to families with children as well as students. We gathered inspiration for the project by documenting a look book of reference images to inform our project's visual language. We studied colors and styling, materials, lighting and form, and architectural elements we wanted to potentially include. From here, we began developing a preliminary visual language consisting of typography, colors, and pictograms.</p>

                    <img>
                </div>
                <p>We then did an audience study to document and identify potential needs to be addressed in our design solution.</p>

                    <img>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <h4>phase two</h4>
                <h4>sign typology</h4>
                <p>For the next phase, we sketched ideas for one sign to fit the following sign types: identification, orientation, directional, regulatory, honorary, celebratory, and interpretive. We designed a location plan to map out where our signs would go on the site, and created a rendered sign vocabulary to portray our different sign types on a place with scaling.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>phase three</h4>
                <h4>design detailing</h4>
                <p>For our last phase, we produced detailes specifications that would enable someone to build the sign types and visualize how they would look in the environment. Two sign types from our system were rendered in detail with exploded views, front and side elevations, and top views. We included all dimensions, materials, and fabrication techniques.</p>

                    <img>
                    <img>
                </div>
                <p>To visualize how our sign system would be implemented and integrated onto the side, all seven sign types were rendered at a proportional scale in their surroundings with people present for scale.</p>
                <div class="project-images">
                    <img>

                <hr>
                <h4>conclusion</h4>
                <p>Our project was compiled into a poster and presented at UC Davis' 2024 Design Senior Showcase <i>Cruess Cruise</i>.</p>
                <p>I want to thank my amazing teammates for making this such a fun and learning project, as well as our professor Tim McNeil for providing critiques that helped us push the boundaries of environmental graphics.</p>
                <p>My specific contributions to this project include: sourcing look book images, ideation sketches, audience study, sign vocabulary, sign specifications.</p>
