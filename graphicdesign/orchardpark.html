                <h4>phase one</h4>
                <h4>design research & visual language</h4>
                <p>To approach this project, we first visited the Orchard Park Apartment housing. We found that the space was lacking in a coherent sign system, and that the site felt more like a corporate workplace building than a residential space.</p>
                <p>As the apartment complex was primarily graduate and family housing, we wanted incorporate fun colors and forms to bring more personality to the space to appeal to families with children as well as students. We gathered inspiration for the project by documenting a look book of reference images to inform our project's visual language. We studied colors and styling, materials, lighting and form, and architectural elements we wanted to potentially include. From here, we began developing a preliminary visual language consisting of typography, colors, and pictograms.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We then did an audience study to document and identify potential needs to be addressed in our design solution. From our audience study, we resolved to design a signage system that was easy to follow, more inclusive of families with children, and also incorporates the history behind the land of Orchard Park by utilizing organic shapes that mimic natural elements.</p>

                <h4>phase two</h4>
                <h4>sign typology</h4>
                <p>For the next phase, we sketched ideas for one sign to fit the following sign types: identification, orientation, directional, regulatory, honorary, celebratory, and interpretive. For our identification sign, we designed the main sign for the Orchard Park complex that would be placed nearby our orientational sign—the map of the entire complex. For our promotional sign, we developed a message board that would be placed outside community spaces in order to provide a space for event advertisements and help foster an improved sense of community among residents. Our directional signs would be inspired by the oak leaf shape and help direct people to their desired buildings, and our regulatory signs would be located in the parking lots to identify the different lots and who is allowed to park in those spaces. For our honorary sign, we created a seating bench that would be placed next to the playground, where a detailed history of the Orchard Park lands will be embedded at an angle to allow for easy reading. Lastly, for our interpretive sign we created a walkway that leds to and also informs the viewer about the history of the Acorn Monument on the complex grounds.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We designed a location plan to map out where our signs would go on the site, and created a rendered sign vocabulary to portray our different sign types on a place with scaling.</p>

                <h4>phase three</h4>
                <h4>design detailing</h4>
                <p>For our last phase, we produced detailes specifications that would enable someone to build the sign types and visualize how they would look in the environment. Two sign types from our system were rendered in detail with exploded views, front and side elevations, and top views. We included all dimensions, materials, and fabrication techniques.</p>

                </div>
                <p>To visualize how our sign system would be implemented and integrated onto the side, all seven sign types were rendered at a proportional scale in their surroundings with people present for scale.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Additionally, we designed in-situ renderings of our seven sign types using SketchUp.</p>

                <h4>additional notes</h4>
                <p>Our project was compiled into a poster and presented at UC Davis' 2024 Design Senior Showcase <i>Cruess Cruise</i>.</p>
                <p>I want to thank my amazing teammates for making this such a fun and learning project, as well as our professor Tim McNeil for providing critiques that helped us push the boundaries of environmental graphics.</p>
                <p>My specific contributions to this project include: sourcing look book images, ideation sketches (Procreate), audience study, sign vocabulary (Photoshop), sign specifications (Illustator).</p>
